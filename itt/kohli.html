    <p id="demo2"><strong> It has been some year for Virat Kohli. India's Test skipper has been in imperious form with his bat this term.
Having played a pivotal role in India's run to the World T20 semis and in Royal Challengers Bangalore's final appearance in the IPL, Kohli took his batting form to Test cricket as well, and completed his first ever double century during the Test series in the West Indies during the summer.
 <span style="color:red">On Sunday, India's Test captain completed his second Test double century with a calculated and composed knock at Indore on Day 2 of the third Test vs New Zealand.</strong></p>
    <p> In the process, Kohli became the first Indian player to scored two double centuries in Tests as captain.The Delhi cricketer, who, despite his incredible run of form in limited overs cricket, has struggled for consistency in Tests, will be relieved to finally get a big score after a few disappointing knocks in the ongoing series.</p>
    <p>With a long season ahead of India, Kohli will be hoping to continue his run in the upcoming months.
In Indore, meanwhile, India continue to go strong on Day 2, with India inching close to a total of 500 and Ajinkya Rahane, who has notched up a 350+ partnership with Kohli, nearing his own double century.</span></p>
